# belly-button-challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Following files are attached:

•	index.html: Main page with an interactive dashboard.

•	app.js: Main JavaScript file for handling and displaying data.

•	bonus.js: Bonus JavaScript file for two types of gauge chart.
